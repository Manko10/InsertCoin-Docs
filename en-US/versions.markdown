# Which InsertCoin ROM version to choose?

There are several InsertCoin ROM versions and editions, but you shouldn't be put
off by their number. Actually, it's quite simple to figure out which version is the
right one for you.

The following editions exist:

## InsertCoin Sense
This is the normal InsertCoin ROM edition for the HTC Sensation / HTC Sensation XE
with latest HTC Sense 3.x.

It exists in two recent versions:

 * InsertCoin ROM latest
   
   This is the latest version with the hottest new stuff. As of the time of this
   writing the current version is 2.5.5-2 (but there might already be a newer version
   when you read this).
   
 * InsertCoin ROM 2.2.5 SE / InsertCoin ROM 2.2.5 SSE
   
   This is currently the most stable version of InsertCoin Sense. If you don't always
   need the latest toys, we recommend you use this instead of the latest branch.
   SE stands for *Second Edition*.

## InsertCoin Sense 2.1
If you own an HTC Desire, this is the edition for you. InsertCoin ROM for HTC Desire
exists in two variants:

 * InsertCoin Sense 2.1 A2SD+
   
   This is the normal edition with Dalvic Cache on the SD card. If you're unsure
   which version to use, you might go well with this one.
   
 * InsertCoin Sense 2.1 CM7
   
   This is basically the same as the version above, but for devices with
   (CM7 HBOOT)[http://alpharev.nl/]. The advantage is that the Dalvic Cache is placed
   on the internal memory which is faster. If you have flashed CM7, you may use this
   variant.

## InsertCoin EVO3D-GSM
As you might guess, this is the EVO 3D GSM compatible version of InsertCoin ROM.
If you own such a device, use this one.
