# InsertCoin ROM documentation (en-US)

Welcome to the official InsertCoin ROM documentation project. It is a community
project which everyone can contribute to. If you like you can take part as well.
It's open to anybody. We'd love to hear from you.

## Important things to know
InsertCoin is a custom ROM for HTC phones cooked by *baadnewz*. You can always find
the latest versions on [insertcoinrom.blogspot.com](http://insertcoinrom.blogspot.com/)
with short instructions about requirements and and changelog.

There is also a huge thread on [XDA-Developers.com](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1198684)
where all development related discussions take place. If you have questions,
suggestions or bug reports, you may probably post it there.

If you want to chat with other InsertCoin ROM users, use the IRC channel *#baadnwz-roms*
on *irc.freenode.net*. Also baad is there quite frequently.

An [XDA-Developers thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=17329560)
for this documentation also exists. Use that for discussion related to the docs.

And of course we would also like to mention all the contributors who have worked
on this project. You'll find a list in the [credits](/master/en-US/credits.html).
