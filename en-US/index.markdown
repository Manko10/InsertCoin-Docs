# InsertCoin ROM Docs

Welcome to the official InsertCoin ROM documentation project. It is a community
project which everyone can contribute to. If you like you can take part as well.
It's open to anybody. We'd love to hear from you.

## Important things to know
InsertCoin is a custom ROM for HTC phones cooked by *baadnewz*. You can always find
the latest versions on [insertcoin-roms.org](http://insertcoin-roms.org/)
with short instructions about requirements and changelog.

### Discussion platforms
For discussion about InsertCoin head over to
[XDA-Developers.com](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1198684)
where many development related discussions take place. If you have questions,
suggestions or bug reports, you may probably post them there.

InsertCoin also has its own forum at
[rootzwiki.com](http://rootzwiki.com/forumdisplay.php?301-Bricked-Kernel-InsertCoin-ROM).

If you want to chat with other InsertCoin ROM users, use the IRC channel *#baadnwz-roms*
on *irc.freenode.net*. Also baad is there quite frequently.

An [XDA-Developers thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=17329560)
for this documentation also exists. You may use that for discussion related to the docs,
but better open an entry in our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/Manko10/InsertCoin-Docs/issues).

### Contributors
And of course we would also like to mention all the contributors who have worked
on this project. You'll find a list in the [credits](/master/en-US/credits.html).

## About this documentation
This is the documentation for the latest **Ice Cream Sandwich** branch
with **Sense 4**. *This branch is currently in Release Candidate state. So don't
expect everything to run as it should, yet.*
If you need a stable version, better go for InsertCoin 5.x.

There are several variants for Sensation, Desire and EVO as well as older versions
of these variants. Have a look at the branches list in the sidebar at the left.

## How can I contribute?
The documentation is maintained in a Git repository, which is hosted on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/).
To find out how to make your own changes to the docs read the tutorials in our little
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/Manko10/InsertCoin-Docs/wiki).
